This is a short TODO list for what to do on each release.
This is purely for me.

1) Check the HTML version build
2) Make and upload the regular PDF
3) Upload list of changes
4) Make both lulu verisons and kdp versions and upload
5) Update the webpage
6) Post on the announcement google group
7) Do release and tag on github

*) NEXT RELEASE: update the "a decade since" on the cover,
it is starting to be incorrect.
*) NEXT RELEASE: update the hyphenation of chapter titles on the cover
