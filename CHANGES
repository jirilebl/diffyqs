<li>Improved wording in the very beginning, making explicit
what a "differential equation" is in words rather than just
giving the example.
<li>Use the actual formula for the Gateway Arch that
the architects used since it's different from what was
on Wikipedia years ago.
<li>Start the marking of Example 0.2.1 where we actually start the example.
<li>Add more detail in solving for the \(C\) and \(k\) in Example 0.2.1.
<li>Improve wording in the example discussing the initial conditions.
<li>In Example 1.1.4, give a second possible initial condition to illustrate
the other possibility of the interval of definition.
<li>Add a short explanation and example to the implicit solution example in
1.3 to show that we can still solve for constants using initial conditions.
<li>Slightly reword the Example 1.3.3 (Bob's coffee) to make it read better
and separate all the variable setup into the second paragraph.
<li>In 1.6, add "equilibria" to the index as alternative for critical
points.
<li>In 1.7, mention "step size" by name when first mentioning it and add it
to the index.  Also use it consistently instead of "interval" which can be
confusing.
<li>Reword the introduction of Euler's method to flow better.
<li>Add a column to Table 1.1 with "Steps done" as we refer to these numbers
a couple of times in the text.
<li>In 1.7, try to avoid the idiomatic phrase "goes down by a factor of" as it is 
a bit confusing.
<li>In Exercise 1.7.2, add assumption that the real solution is greater
than the approximate ones, otherwise it's not really possible.
<li>Remove the extraneous remark about the local nature of Poincare Lemma
in 1.8, we cover this in Example 1.8.4 in more detail.  Then add a remark
before Example 1.8.5
about the case where the set has no holes such as the entire plane or the
half-plane we just saw.
<li>Add a footnote on the wording "equipotential curve" and add it to the index
and add Poincare Lemma to the index as well.
<li>Emphasize the forms of the solutions in 2.2
by boxing them to make them easy to pick out.
<li>For the answers in the back for exercises in 2.4, make sure they all
include units
<li>In 2.5, add one more minor example about multiplying by \(x\) to
emphasize that we must get rid of the duplication in the entire trial
solution.
<li>In the last comment on undetermined coefficients, the comment should be
about particular solutions, otherwise it might lead to students duplicating
the complementary solutions.
<li>In Exercise 2.6.103, give units to be consistent with the other
exercises.
<li>Answer in the back to 3.1.104 ordered more naturally and in the more
standard form.
<li>In the answer in the back for 3.1.103, use \(u_1,u_2,u_3\) not to
confuse with \(x .\)
<li>In the discussion introducing the fundamental matrix, mention
the nonuniqueness of the matrix, we can multiply on the right
by an invertible constant matrix.
<li>In exercise 3.5.102 use \(P\) for the matrix for more consistency.
<li>Rename section 3.7 to "Repeated eigenvalues".
<li>In 3.7, simplify the definition of geometric multiplicity and add a
remark to the definition of "defect" as to its meaning.
<li>In 3.7, just use \(A\) for the matrix always instead of going back to \(P\) for a moment.
<li>In the beginning 3.8,
we are using \(A\) for just about any matrix
and \(P\) for the coefficient matrix, so don't flip to \(A\) till later.
