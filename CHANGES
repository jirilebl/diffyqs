<li>Improved wording in the very beginning, making explicit
what a "differential equation" is in words rather than just
giving the example.
<li>Use the actual formula for the Gateway Arch that
the architects used since it's different from what was
on Wikipedia years ago.
<li>Start the marking of Example 0.2.1 where we actually start the example.
<li>Add more detail in solving for the \(C\) and \(k\) inExample 0.2.1.
<li>Improve wording in the example discussing the initial conditions.
<li>In Example 1.1.4, give a second possible initial condition to illustrate
the other possibility of the interval of definition.
