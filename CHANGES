<li>To improve readability, hypthenate first-order, second-order,
constant-coefficient, etc. when used as a compound adjective.
<li>Apparently the formula for the Gateway Arch in St. Louis is not
inscribed anywhere inside the arch (that is a myth apparently).  So just
say "per the National Park Service."
<li>Explicitly mention "variable-coefficient" at the end of 0.3.
<li>In Example 1.1.2, use \(t\) for the dummy variable to be
consistent with the discussion above.
<li>Be somewhat more precise in Example 1.1.6.
<li>Say a little bit more on why Example 1.2.1 is nontrivial.
<li>In Example 3.1.1, write out the equations for the
arbitrary constants.  This is the first example, it should be
as explicit as possible.
<li>Reword parts of Examples 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 to be more specific.
<li>In Example 3.1.4, add a short paragraph
to explain why \(x=u_1\) really is the solution to the original
equation.
<li>In subsection 3.1.4, reword the note about similarity to 1.6 and give
an explicit link to 1.6.
<li>Define what we mean by "square" matrix in 3.2.1.
<li>In subsection 3.2.4, mark "elementary row operations"
as a defined term and add it to the index.  Add
"row operations" to the index also for the appendix.
<li>At the end of 3.5 mention that repeated eigenvalues
have the same behavior roughly (that is, the table still applies).
<li>In Exercises 3.5.2 and 3.5.3, explicitly say that the student
should draw the vector field (it was hopefully implied in the previous
wording, but be explicit here).
<li>In 3.7.2, when first solving for the generalized eigenvalue in the
example, explicitly say that \(\vec{w}\) should solve
\({(A-3I)}^2 \vec{w} = \vec{0},\) to make the argument be clear.
<li>In the section notes for 3.8, refer to 7.1
<li>The paragraph above Theorem 3.8.2 was a little confusing about
where the commutativity comes in, so rewrite it a little.
<li>At the end of Example 3.9.3, give the general solution explicitly.
<li>In the explanation of Theorem 4.1.1 (the "proof"), include the "(t)"
in the computation of the integrals, seems clearer that way.
<li>In Example 4.2.1, give the definition of \(f(t)\) for a few of the
intervals.
<li>In subsection 4.2.3, write out the first few terms of the Fourier
series in the boxed equation for clarity, and also explicitly
say that we say "nth harmonic" for the nth term of the series.
<li>In examples 4.2.3 and 4.2.4, motivate the functions tiny bit more
than saying they appear in applications.
<li>A bit more detail in Example 4.3.1, such as explicitly noting the L.
<li>In Example 4.3.1 say that we extend (4.8) periodically and be clearer
about what we mean about just saying piecewise smooth without mentioning an
interval.
<li>In Example 4.3.6, give more detail about the second
derivative not existing by explicitly showing the first
derivative on \([-1,1]\) and plotting it in 
the figure 4.11.
<li>Just before the Example 4.5.2, the paragraph is not quite right.
There is still just one resonance frequency, we're just hitting it with
the overtones.
<li>In all of 4.6, 4.7, 4.8 more consistently label the ranges
for the \(x\) and \(t\) variables for the equation and the side conditions, in particular
give the \(t > 0\) for the boundary conditions, and give the
ranges whenever introducing all the side conditions.  Also explicitly
mention the range when introducing the type of problem we are solving in
each section.
<li>Add diagram of the \((x,t)\) space for the region that we
are solving the heat equation in subsection 4.6.1.
<li>In the first paragraph of 4.6.2, also mention that the heat
equation is homogeneous as that is also needed for superposition.
<li>In the paragraph introducing superposition in 4.7, mention homogeneity
of the equation and also of the side conditions.
<li>In 4.9 and 4.10 in the diagrams for the region, make the region gray
and make the boundary thicker.
<li>In the exercises in 4.9, we mentioned the region by name, but in the
text we no longer use this (for decades now:) so rephrase
to remove the name.
<li><b>Change Exercise 5.2.102 to fix erratum</b>.
Change the initial shape
of the beam to be \(\sin^2(\pi x)\) to be
consistent with fixed ends.
<li>Make a clearer explanation of why resonance does not occur for
even \(n\) in the problem being solved in subsection 5.3.1.
<li>Just after 6.3.1, give both directions in formulas
for clarity.
<li>In Example 6.3.3, reverse the order of the factors
as that's the way we write the convolution integral.
<li>In section A.4, make sure to use "a basis" rather than "the basis"
where appropriate.
<li>Make Example A.4.1 into an enumerate to make it easier to parse.
<li>Expand Example A.4.2 with a couple of new examples and make it into
an enumerate to make it easier to parse.
<li>In Exercise A.5.5, part a) mention that it is a basis of
\({\mathbb{R}}^3.\)
<li>Add a few more useful Laplace transforms to the table in Appendix B.
<li>In Appendix B, the transform for \(t^p\) is valid for \(p > -1 .\)
<li>Many other small clarifications and improvements.
