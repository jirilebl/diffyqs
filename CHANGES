<li>Improved wording in the very beginning, making explicit
what a "differential equation" is in words rather than just
giving the example.
<li>Use the actual formula for the Gateway Arch that
the architects used since it's different from what was
on Wikipedia years ago.
<li>Start the marking of Example 0.2.1 where we actually start the example.
<li>Add more detail in solving for the \(C\) and \(k\) in Example 0.2.1.
<li>Improve wording in the example discussing the initial conditions.
<li>In Example 1.1.4, give a second possible initial condition to illustrate
the other possibility of the interval of definition.
<li>Add a short explanation and example to the implicit solution example in
1.3 to show that we can still solve for constants using initial conditions.
<li>Slightly reword the Example 1.3.3 (Bob's coffee) to make it read better
and separate all the variable setup into the second paragraph.
<li>In 1.6, add "equilibria" to the index as alternative for critical
points.
<li>In 1.7, mention "step size" by name when first mentioning it and add it
to the index.  Also use it consistently instead of "interval" which can be
confusing.
<li>Reword the introduction of Euler's method to flow better.
<li>Add a column to Table 1.1 with "Steps done" as we refer to these numbers
a couple of times in the text.
<li>In 1.7, try to avoid the idiomatic phrase "goes down by a factor of" as it is 
a bit confusing.
<li>In Exercise 1.7.2, add assumption that the real solution is greater
than the approximate ones, otherwise it's not really possible.
<li>Remove the extraneous remark about the local nature of Poincare Lemma
in 1.8, we cover this in Example 1.8.4 in more detail.  Then add a remark
before Example 1.8.5
about the case where the set has no holes such as the entire plane or the
half-plane we just saw.
<li>Add a footnote on the wording "equipotential curve" and add it to the index
and add Poincare Lemma to the index as well.
