<li>Add links to the new mirror of the website at jirilebl.github.io/diffyqs
<li>Improved wording in the very beginning, making explicit
what a "differential equation" is in words rather than just
giving the example.
<li>Use the actual formula for the Gateway Arch that
the architects used since it's different from what was
on Wikipedia years ago.
<li>Start the marking of Example 0.2.1 where we actually start the example.
<li>Add more detail in solving for the \(C\) and \(k\) in Example 0.2.1.
<li>Improve wording in the example discussing the initial conditions.
<li>In Example 1.1.4, give a second possible initial condition to illustrate
the other possibility of the interval of definition.
<li>Add a short explanation and example to the implicit solution example in
1.3 to show that we can still solve for constants using initial conditions.
<li>Slightly reword the Example 1.3.3 (Bob's coffee) to make it read better
and separate all the variable setup into the second paragraph.
<li>In 1.6, add "equilibria" to the index as alternative for critical
points.
<li>In 1.7, mention "step size" by name when first mentioning it and add it
to the index.  Also use it consistently instead of "interval" which can be
confusing.
<li>Reword the introduction of Euler's method to flow better.
<li>Add a column to Table 1.1 with "Steps done" as we refer to these numbers
a couple of times in the text.
<li>In 1.7, try to avoid the idiomatic phrase "goes down by a factor of" as it is 
a bit confusing.
<li>In Exercise 1.7.2, add assumption that the real solution is greater
than the approximate ones, otherwise it's not really possible.
<li>Remove the extraneous remark about the local nature of Poincare Lemma
in 1.8, we cover this in Example 1.8.4 in more detail.  Then add a remark
before Example 1.8.5
about the case where the set has no holes such as the entire plane or the
half-plane we just saw.
<li>Add a footnote on the wording "equipotential curve" and add it to the index
and add Poincare Lemma to the index as well.
<li>Emphasize the forms of the solutions in 2.2
by boxing them to make them easy to pick out.
<li>For the answers in the back for exercises in 2.4, make sure they all
include units
<li>In 2.5, add one more minor example about multiplying by \(x\) to
emphasize that we must get rid of the duplication in the entire trial
solution.
<li>In the last comment on undetermined coefficients, the comment should be
about particular solutions, otherwise it might lead to students duplicating
the complementary solutions.
<li>Reword parts of subsection 2.6.2 to be clearer.
<li>In Exercise 2.6.103, give units to be consistent with the other
exercises.
<li>Answer in the back to 3.1.104 ordered more naturally and in the more
standard form.
<li>In the answer in the back for 3.1.103, use \(u_1,u_2,u_3\) not to
confuse with \(x .\)
<li>In the discussion introducing the fundamental matrix, mention
the nonuniqueness of the matrix, we can multiply on the right
by an invertible constant matrix.
<li>In exercise 3.5.102 use \(P\) for the matrix for more consistency.
<li>Rename section 3.7 to "Repeated eigenvalues".
<li>In 3.7, simplify the definition of geometric multiplicity and add a
remark to the definition of "defect" as to its meaning.
<li>In 3.7, just use \(A\) for the matrix always instead of going back to \(P\) for a moment.
<li>In the beginning 3.8,
we are using \(A\) for just about any matrix
and \(P\) for the coefficient matrix, so don't flip to \(A\) till later.
<li>If we are boxing things (and we are),
box the definition of Laplace transform on page 294.
<li>Change the hint on Exercise 6.1.103 to say
"Shifting property" as that's a neater way of doing it,
and good practice of using it.
<li>When giving the second shifting property on page 302,
mention that \(a \geq 0 .\)
<li>In Exercise 6.2.9, give more precise instructions than just "Show".
<li>Explicitly give the meaning of the commutativity of convolution.
<li>Introduce Volterra integral equations in a slightly more intelligent way.
<li>Justify the "unit mass" for the pulse in beginning of 6.4.1, and get rid
of the word "convenient" it is not convenient, it is the whole thing.
<li>In Theorem 7.1.2, explicitly state that \(A\) going to infinity
means divergent series.
<li>Reword the paragraph about root/ratio test being more complicated 
than simply computing the \(A,\) and add a very short inline example,
as such series often appear in online homework systems made for other books.
<li>In Example 8.1.2, add a bit more detail.
<li>Add a note about the "circles" simple linear system having no limit
cycles despite having closed trajectories after example 8.4.2.
<li><b>Exercise A.5.105 changed to fix erratum</b>.  The three vectors given
as an orthogonal basis was not actually orthogonal.  Replace the last
vector with \((0,1,1)\) to make it orthogonal.  Also changed the
vectors in a), b), c) so that the answers are again nice.
